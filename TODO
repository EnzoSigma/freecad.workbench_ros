- Find a better name for the workbench:
  - CROSS (CAD and ROS, Open-Source Symbiosis or CAD and ROS, Open-Source Synergy), the logo could be similar to the Xacro icon
  - CROW (CAD and ROS Open-source Workbench)
  - FROST (FreeCAD ROS S? Tool)
- Add the possiblity to place a robot.
- Implement the placement of xacro objects in workcell builder
- Solve elements out of their parent group (e.g. XacroObject) on document restore
- Use a workbench-global ROS_WORKSPACE variable (init with environment variable $ROS_WORKSPACE on start) and save only the path relative to ROS_WORKSPACE in OutputPath. If ROS_WORKSPACE is not defined, ask for it on first export or import.
- Maintain a list of generated objects in Robot when using `robot_from_urdf` and offer a function `clean` to remove them.
- Respect joint limits.
- Use `Joint.onBeforeChange` to remember the parent and child RosLinks, then restore `Parent` and `Child` with `obj.Parent = ros_name(saved_parent_link)
- Remove from `Joint.Child` enum all links that:
  - are already child of a joint
  - are parent of this joint, recursively (if not covered by the first condition
- Avoid duplicating mesh objects when importing
- Fix visualization of prismatic joints
- Add a class WorkbenchObject that knows all properties of an object and
  defines a function self.is_execute_ready that
  returns True only when all properties are defined.
- URDF editor integrated in Robot
- Avoid duplication of Label2
- Validate Label2 (and Label if Label2 is not defined) against valid URDF names
- Clear necessary fields when `XacroObject.InputFile` is reset
- Fix Attachment for the root link in `assembly_from_urdf`
- Add two coordinate systems for each Ros::Joint (parent = urdf_joint.origin, child = parent * get_actuation_placement())
- Do not create an extra FreeCAD link when importing a URDF since the part can be directly added to the ROS links (i.e. instead of creating a FreeCAD link and adding the FreeCAD link to the ROS link). FreeCAD links are only necessary if the parts are in a different file.
- Support all joint types
